My name is Ben Caldwell and I am a graduate student at the University of Chicago. 
I am co-advised by Professors Stuart Kurtz and Robert Rand. I am a member of Robert Rand's CHIQP lab. 
I am interested in type theory, logic, and formal verification. 
I enjoy applying my interests in the quantum setting, mainly working on formal verification of quantum systems. 
I am also an avid Haskell fan and will stop at nothing to shoehorn it into anything I'm working on.

When I am not working on research, I am working as a teaching assistant or finding irresponsible projects to work on. 
My irresponsible projects include independent game development, hotdog stand theme creation, and image dithering. 
For my educational experience and teaching, check out my Education page. For more information on my projects, please check out my research page.
