<p>My name is Ben Caldwell and I am a graduate student at the University of Chicago. I am co-advised by Professors Stuart Kurtz and Robert Rand. I am a member of Robert Rand's CHIQP lab. I am interested in type theory, logic, and formal verification. I enjoy applying my interests in the quantum setting, mainly working on formal verification of quantum systems. I am also an avid Haskell fan and will stop at nothing to shoehorn it into anything I'm working on.</p>

<p>When I am not working on research, I am working as a teaching assistant or finding irresponsible projects to work on. My irresponsible projects include independent game development, hotdog stand theme creation, and image dithering.</p>
